                My name is Tommy Djärf. <br> I'm a 40-year-old electrician who has recently embarked on a journey to become a web developer. I live with my family just outside of Åre, where I enjoy the mountains and the snow in the winter.
            </p>
            <p>
                Coding has been a source of both frustration and immense reward for me so far. 
                Finding the solutions to the problems I encounter is incredibly satisfying. 
                Learning so much new information every day is a lot of fun, and it feels like my 
                brain is slowly coming out of autopilot mode and functioning as it's supposed to.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is one of the first projects that I feel proud of. Please take a look around, 
                and don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions! My portfolio will be updated as my journey progresses. 
                Currently, I am studying to become a web developer at the University of Jönköping. Hopefully, 
                I will be finished in a couple of years and embark on a new career, armed with a wealth of new knowledge, 
                but with the understanding that there is always more to learn every day.

                I started my career as an electrician when I was just 16 years old and still in school. Initially, 
                I worked in service and construction around Jönköping, which was my hometown at the time. In 2006, 
                a friend and I packed our bags and traveled to Norway to work on their large-scale projects along the coastline. 
                I transitioned from a small company with only 5 employees to a massive construction site with over 3000 people. 
                Initially, it was quite overwhelming, but as I adjusted, I found it to be an incredibly enjoyable experience. 
                I had the opportunity to meet many people I otherwise never would have.
            </p>
            <p>
                This journey has been filled with various positions and opportunities to explore different places. 
                Since 2013, I have been working offshore on numerous rigs around the North Sea. It's been a real adventure, 
                with a wide range of missions and challenges.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to my work as an electrician, I am also a certified ski instructor. 
                Skiing is one of my greatest passions in life. Being a ski instructor has been an immensely rewarding experience, 
                providing valuable skills such as managing large groups, public speaking, and fostering teamwork. 
                Seeing individuals learn new things and achieve what they never thought possible has been incredibly fulfilling. 
                These skills have also proven to be very useful in my leadership roles in the North Sea.
